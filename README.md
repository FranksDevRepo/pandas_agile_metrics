# Pandas Agile Metrics

Actionable Agile metrics analysis tool kit based on Python.

Inspired by https://bitbucket.org/marcobresciani/aamfp/

Pandas library provides python with excel super powers.

## The Problem

How do I provide many teams a quick and easy way to process team metrics that have been captured in the format recommened by [Daniel S Vacanti](https://twitter.com/danvacanti?lang=en)?

See [Actionable Agile data file format](https://actionableagile.com/format-data-file) for more information.

## An answer

### Use https://mybinder.org/ to turn a Git repo into a collection of interactive notebooks

Then Interact with your notebooks in a live environment! Upload your data to the notebook. Run the cells. Modify code to tweek. Download your charts. The MyBinder virtual environment will be deleted when its not in use anymore.

> Click on the button below to launch your own JupyterLab session. Note it can sometimes take a while. Use SHIFT+ENTER to run individual cells in the JupyterLab notebook.

See the video on how to launch your private JupyterLab session, upload some data and then run the Notebook cells.

Clone this repo, to your local computer, setup a Python 3.7 environment, install libraries & run JupyterLab locally.
